# TIC-TAC-TOE
A simple web-based implementation of the classic Tic‑Tac‑Toe game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Players can take turns marking “X” and “O” on a 3×3 grid, and the game determines the winner or a draw.
## Overview
This repository provides a minimal, front-end only Tic-Tac-Toe game. It uses basic web technologies and simple game logic — a good starting point for beginners who want to understand how Tic-Tac-Toe works in a browser environment.
## Contents
1. a.html — the main HTML file that renders the game board and UI
2. style.css — CSS for styling the game layout and appearance
3. game.js — JavaScript containing the game logic: move handling, win/draw detection, and turn management
## Purpose
This project demonstrates how a classic board game can be implemented using only frontend technologies. It’s useful for learning core HTML/CSS/JS concepts, practicing DOM manipulation, and understanding basic game-state logic.
